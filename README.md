# Multi-Agent Architecture for Kubernetes Penetration Testing

This document outlines the multi-agent architecture designed for penetration testing in Kubernetes using Letta as the agent server. The agents are based on the **Deepseek R1-Distill-Qwen-8B** model, and each agent is fine-tuned for its specific role. The architecture facilitates a complete workflow—from initial cluster assessment to vulnerability scanning, analysis, and exploitation.

## Overview

The system is composed of an **Orchestrator Agent** and four specialized agents:
- **Orchestrator Agent** (Coordinator)
- **Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent**
- **Vulnerability Scanning Agent**
- **Analysis & Exploitation Agent**

This structure ensures clear role separation, modularity, and scalability while supporting asynchronous execution among agents.

## Agents and Their Responsibilities

### 1. Orchestrator Agent (Coordinator)
**Responsibilities:**
- Acts as the primary entry point for user requests.
- Delegates tasks to specialized agents based on the workflow.
- Maintains the global state of operations and aggregates final results.

**Key Functions:**
- **Workflow Coordination:** Breaks down high-level commands into actionable steps.
- **Task Dispatch:** Calls the appropriate agent(s) sequentially or in parallel as required.
- **Result Aggregation:** Compiles responses from other agents into a final, coherent output.

---

### 2. Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
**Responsibilities:**
- Interfaces directly with the Kubernetes cluster with full access permissions.
- Manages cluster resources, including pods, services, and custom resource definitions (CRDs).

**Key Functions:**
- **Cluster State Retrieval:** Gathers details about pods, services, namespaces, roles, and CRDs.
- **CRD Creation & Management:** Generates and applies YAML definitions for scanning jobs and other tasks.
- **Storage Interaction:** Manages data transfers with MinIO for storing scan results and logs.
- **Automation Hooks:** Facilitates actions such as scaling pods or deploying scanning containers.

---

### 3. Vulnerability Scanning Agent
**Responsibilities:**
- Orchestrates security scanning processes across the cluster.
- Manages scan job configuration, execution, and result storage.

**Key Functions:**
- **Scan Job Configuration:** Determines which scans to run (e.g., SCB scans, container image vulnerabilities, network scans).
- **Scan Execution:** Initiates and monitors scanning jobs via CRDs and dedicated scanning pods.
- **Results Management:** Ensures that all scan artifacts and reports are stored in the MinIO instance.
- **Progress Reporting:** Notifies the Orchestrator on the scan status and completion.

---

### 4. Analysis & Exploitation Agent
**Responsibilities:**
- Analyzes vulnerability reports from the scanning process.
- Decides and executes exploitation strategies based on prioritized vulnerabilities.

**Key Functions:**
- **Vulnerability Analysis:** Classifies findings using vulnerability databases and CVE references.
- **Prioritization:** Chooses vulnerabilities to exploit based on risk severity and impact.
- **Exploit Strategy:** Identifies and executes relevant exploits (e.g., using Metasploit modules or custom scripts).
- **Post-Exploitation Analysis:** Gathers additional data for lateral movement or remediation.
- **Reporting:** Summarizes exploited vulnerabilities and suggests further penetration testing steps.

---

## Workflow Example

1. **User Command:**  
   *"Perform a penetration test on my cluster. Identify critical vulnerabilities and, if feasible, exploit them to prove impact."*

2. **Orchestrator Agent → Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent:**  
   - Retrieve cluster details and set up necessary CRDs for scanning.

3. **Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent → Vulnerability Scanning Agent:**  
   - Create scanning jobs (e.g., SCB scans) and prepare the environment for data storage in MinIO.

4. **Vulnerability Scanning Agent:**  
   - Execute scans, monitor progress, and upload scan results to MinIO.

5. **Vulnerability Scanning Agent → Orchestrator Agent:**  
   - Notify completion and provide access details to scan results.

6. **Orchestrator Agent → Analysis & Exploitation Agent:**  
   - Forward the scan results for analysis and exploitation planning.

7. **Analysis & Exploitation Agent:**  
   - Analyze the vulnerabilities, prioritize risks, and execute appropriate exploits.
   - Generate a report detailing successful exploit paths, vulnerabilities, and recommendations.

8. **Orchestrator Agent → User:**  
   - Aggregate and present the final penetration testing report.

## Scalability and Future Enhancements

- **Fine-Tuning:**  
  Each agent is fine-tuned from the base model to excel in its designated domain.
  
- **Security Boundaries:**  
  The Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent is granted cluster admin rights, while other agents have limited permissions according to their function.
  
- **Modular Extensibility:**  
  Future modules (e.g., Reporting Agent or Remediation Agent) can be integrated without overhauling the entire architecture.
  
- **Asynchronous Execution:**  
  The system supports asynchronous calls between agents, enabling efficient, parallel processing where appropriate.

## Conclusion

This multi-agent architecture leverages Letta and Deepseek R1-Distill-Qwen-8B to deliver a comprehensive and scalable solution for Kubernetes penetration testing. With clear delineation of responsibilities among the Orchestrator, Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent, Vulnerability Scanning Agent, and Analysis & Exploitation Agent, the system is well-equipped to perform end-to-end security assessments and provide actionable insights.
